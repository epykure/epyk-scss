# Epyk CSS Utility

This package will help on the generation of scss files.

It will aggregated the CSS modules generated by Epyk to a structure or scss files with a common confoguration module.

This should help when changing themes.

SCSS is commonly used in the TypeScript and JavaScript web framework to simplify the management of the style sheets.

## Usage

Install as a normal Python package

> pip install epyk_scss

Then use it as below on an existing report generated from Epyk.

```py
from epyk_scss import compiler

css = compiler.Scss('style.css')
css.complie()
```
